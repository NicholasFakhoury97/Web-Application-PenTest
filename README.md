- fping is used to check the reachability of the target machine. This command verifies that the target machine is online and responding to network requests. It helps confirm that there are no connectivity issues before proceeding with further attacks.

## 2. Network Scanning

### Nmap Scan Command

- **Command:** `nmap -A -p- 192.168.1.228`

- **Breakdown:**
  - **nmap:** The command-line tool used for network discovery and security auditing.
  - **-A:** Enables Aggressive Scan with features:
    - OS Detection: Identifies the operating system of the target host.
    - Version Detection: Finds versions of services running on open ports.
    - Script Scanning: Runs predefined scripts to gather more information or check vulnerabilities.
    - Traceroute: Maps the route taken by packets from source to destination.
  - **-p-:** Scans all ports from 1 to 65535.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5211edef-3a90-49ff-9df0-adc7c8787ffb)
 
  -  SQL Injection is a common web application vulnerability that allows attackers to interact with the backend database. By capturing and analyzing HTTP requests, you can identify SQL Injection points and craft payloads to exploit them.

### SQL Injection Testing with Sqlmap

- **Command to Check Databases:**
  ```bash
  sqlmap -r GOT --dbs
  ```
- **Dump Databases and User Info:**
  - **Command:** 
    ```bash
    sqlmap -r GOT -D Staff --dump-all --batch
    ```
  - **Dump Users:**
    ```bash
    sqlmap -r GOT -D users --dump-all --batch

## 4. Local File Inclusion (LFI)

### Testing for LFI

- **Discovery of LFI Vulnerability:**
  - After obtaining the admin credentials, we logged into the web application and noticed that additional features such as "Manage" and "Add Record" were unlocked. However, the footer now displayed the message "File does not exist," suggesting a file inclusion issue.
  
  - We hypothesized that the missing or misplaced file might be included in the footer dynamically. To investigate this further, we tested the URL parameter used for file inclusion. We appended the `?file=` parameter to the URL, attempting to include various local files.

- **URL Parameter Testing:**
  - We used a common LFI testing URL parameter and tried accessing the `/etc/passwd` file with a URL like:
    ```
    http://example.com/welcome.php?file=/etc/passwd
    ```
  - The application returned the contents of `/etc/passwd`, confirming that the LFI vulnerability exists. This file contains sensitive user information, highlighting the risk of unauthorized access due to improper file inclusion.

  - Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities allow attackers to include files from the serverâ€™s filesystem. Testing for LFI helps determine if the application improperly exposes files, potentially revealing sensitive information such as `/etc/passwd`.
